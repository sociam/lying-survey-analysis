That became the case when I realized that anything posted to facebook became their intelectual property. Also no matter what you posted and erased there's always a copy somewhere of what you wrote. Oh and all the commercials that appear on facebook are a consequence of what i've looked at previously (basically they study the people on facebook to suggest a targeted advertisement).
Yeah, that kinda disgusted me from social media.
As a consequence, me and a friend decided to encrypt our messages with online algorithims. That was fun.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1
